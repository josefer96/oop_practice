# Concepts in Object Oriented Programming

## Class

### __init__ (initializer)
-Use the __init__() function to assign values to object properties, or other operations that are necessary to do when the object is being created

### Attribute (Parameter)
- descriptions of the object
- instance attribute (first_name)
- class - level attribute (WSU)

### Methods (Action)

- instance method

    - method that can be performed on the object
- class method

    - allows us to create and modify class level data
- static method

    -does not have access to cls or instance attributes but performs action within the class
- magic method

    - reserved methods that perfrom a specific task '__str__'

## inherentance
-inherentance allow us to dfine a class that inherits all the methods and properties from another class.
- Parent Class(Student)

## Polymorphism
- methods/functions/operators with the same name that can be executed on many objects or classes
